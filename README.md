## Picombo
Picombo is a Python library that offers interactive filtering functionality. When a list object is provided to Picombo, it displays a filtering interface to the user, allowing them to interactively filter through the list. Once a user selects an item, Picombo returns that value.

In essence, it's like having Percol as a library that can be freely integrated into any program.

## Installation

```
$ pip install picombo
```

## Demonstration
The following command filters a list of the names of all countries.

```
$ pipenv install
$ pipenv run demo
```
